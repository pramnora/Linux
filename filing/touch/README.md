NOTE(S):
--------

the 'rm' command is very powerful...; and, also, has many different variations;  
and, therefore, one needs to be really very careful, indeed, exactly how one chooses to use it.    
> rm *  
...will remove AnyFileName.AnyFileNameExtension (meaning absolutely 'everything'...?!)  
> rm f*  
...will remove specifically files which begin with the letter: 'f'  
> rm f*.txt  
...will remove files which start with letter: 'f'/and, also, have file name extension: .txt  
The more specific you are with this command...; then, the less likely you will run into errors;  

-----

Linux, gives one full control over the file system...;   
which is, at once, very enabling...;   
but, can also lead to huge costly errors...;  
costly in terms of time/if not, also, money.  

Recently, I went and accidentally deleted a whole entire folder called: programs;  
into which I stored loads of code:   
qb64/python/streamlit/pandas/matplotlib/ruby/bash/lisp/-etc.  
and, much to my own completely miserable shock/horror,   
I cannot get *any* of those files back, again...?!  

Regardless of the fact that it took me absolute ages:   
months/years to write/build that coding collection.  
So, WARNING be very careful when you are using Linux to remove stuff.  

Doing "back up's", and, regularly...is a really good thing...;   
so, that you can still get to recover back any data that has been lost entirely accidentally.  

Before deliberately chosing to go delete something...;   
you might wish to carefuly consider making a back up copy using the 'cp' command    
to store the folder/file contents elsewhere;    
as opposed to deleting, first...; then, having huge regrets, later on...?!
